**py3d** is a 3d computational geometry library. It is not stable currently. But it is designed to be simple, stable and customizable:

* simple means api will be less than usual and progressive
* stable means it will have less dependeces and modules, and it will be fully tested
* customizable means it will be a libaray rather than an application, it only provide data structures and functions handling basic geometry concepts
