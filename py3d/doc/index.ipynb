    "\n",
    "* simple means api will be less than usual and progressive\n",
    "* stable means it will have less dependeces and modules, and it will be fully tested\n",
    "* customizable means it will be a libaray rather than an application, it only provide data structures and functions handling basic geometry concepts\n",
